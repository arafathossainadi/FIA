                            <h4>1. Policy Introduction</h4>
                            <p>
                               Faith in Action is committed to a comprehensive policy of Equality of Opportunity in Employment in which all individuals are treated on the basis of their relevant merits and abilities. Faith in Action seeks to promote good recruitment and selection practices and to ensure that in all cases the best candidate for the regular position is appointed. <br><br>
                               When recruiting staff, it is important not to discriminate on any unfair or unlawful grounds, e.g. sex, race, disability, marital status, sexual orientation and/or religion or belief. <br><br>
                               Responsibility for ensuring that the correct procedures are followed lies with the head office /project Manager responsibilities or recruiting and will be monitored by Human Resources. All who are involved in the recruitment and selection of staff are expected to observe these procedures and to ensure that their actions are consistent with the principles of these procedures. All members of each Appointing Committee must have undertaken orientation in recruitment and selection.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">2. Recruiting of Family Members</h4>
                            <p>
                                Faith in Action encourage to acknowledge a disclosure in case of regular staff or consultants or contractors or service providers who is related by blood or marriage to any Faith in Action Board member or staff. Family member includes spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandson & daughter, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece or first cousin or any of the above as an "in-law" related by marriage.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">3. Planning and preparation</h4>
                            <p>
                                A staff request should be raised by the Executive Director and obtained approval from the Executive Committee. <br><br>
                                A new post requires a Job Description which should be raised through HR and respective supervisor/manager. Once financial clearance has been provided, HR officer will take further actions. <br><br>
                                It is extremely important that the content of the job description clearly reflects the duties, skills and experience required for the post. A fully detailed and clear submission of a job description, in standard format, will normally result in the grading confirmation within 4 working days. In certain circumstances, further information may be required by HR before grading can be confirmed.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">4. Advertising and recruitment timetable</h4>
                            <p>
                                Advertising <br>
                                Staff recruitment adverts will be placed by the HR. <br>
                                Once the vacancy has gone through the approval process in HR the HR Coordinator will arrange adverts through common magazines and websites at least 45 days before the interview.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">5. Membership of appointing/interview committee</h4>
                            <p>
                                The composition of the 3- or 5-members appointing panels will be nominated by the Executive Committee. A Convener should be identified at this stage. <br>  
                                The role of the Convener is: <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>ensure fairness and equality for all candidates. </li>
                                    <li>assign areas to be covered by each panel member; </li>
                                    <li>greet the candidate and introduce him/her to all the members of the panel; </li>
                                    <li>direct the questioning and ensure continuity; </li>
                                    <li>manage the interview process especially in relation to time management; </li>
                                    <li>record initial scores; </li>
                                    <li>vote where consensus cannot be reached. </li>
                                    <li>record final decision. </li>
                                    <li>ensure a decision is made concerning probation for academic appointments (as appropriate)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                                When appointing the Committee consideration should be given to the following: <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The appointment/interview committee's gender balance should reflect the gender representation of the subject specialist and at a minimum there should be at least one person of each sex represented; </li>
                                    <li>Any member of an Appointing/interview Committee should declare any conflicts of interest to the Convener; </li>
                                    <li>Appointing/interview Committee members cannot act as referees for candidates being interviewed; </li>
                                    <li>Orientation in Recruitment and Selection is mandatory;</li>
                                    <li>Careful consideration should be given to take account of principles of Equality and Diversity.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">6. Short listing</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Appointing Committee is to reach a shortlist in a way which is reliable, valid and fair by comparing evidence in the application against the essential & desirable criteria for the post. <br><br>
                                The job description should identify those essential and desirable criteria which can be assessed from the details contained in the application form/CV/letter of application. It is extremely important that the essential and desirable criteria are compiled with the needs of the post and the skills required. <br><br>
                                The respective Project Manager will email/phone call a shortlist assessment form and interview request form to all members of the Appointing/interview Committee once the closing date has been reached. All members of the Appointing/interview Committee should normally be involved with this process. <br><br>
                                All candidates called for interview must meet all essential criteria, where a candidate does not meet one or more of the essential criteria, that a candidate cannot be invited to interview. If you have a large number of applicants who appear to meet the essential criteria, then the desirable criteria should be used to identify those who are most suitable. <br><br>
                                It is essential that all information is completed correctly on the shortlist assessment form in order that this can be used as a formal record for candidates whether they have been shortlisted or not. The individuals can potentially appeal against a decision not to be shortlisted, decisions taken therefore must be fair, objective and non-discriminatory and properly recorded.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">7. References</h4>
                            <p>
                                The purpose of an employment reference is to obtain information about the past employment history of a candidate. References need to be treated with some caution by the Panel, as they have the potential to be indirectly discriminatory due to the possible prejudice of the 2 referees. This is generally a policy decision and should not be seen as a negative comment on the person's suitability. <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Authorization must be obtained from each candidate prior to any contact with the referees. </li>
                                    <li>At least one reference must be the candidate’s current employer (where applicable). </li>
                                    <li>References are confidential to members of the Appointing Committee and should not be passed to anyone else, including the candidate. </li>
                                    <li>A final offer will not be confirmed until all references have been received. </li>
                                    <li>References should be used to inform the final decision-making process. </li>
                                    <li>All references will be obtained from Human Resources.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">8. The interview</h4>
                            <p>
                                Each member of the Appointing/interview Committee should, before the interview:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>review job description</li>
                                    <li>assess the application form /CV</li>
                                    <li>bearing in mind the essential & desirable criteria decide which areas to explore and in what sequence – normally coordinated by the Convener</li>
                                </ul>
                                Applications of short-listed candidates must not be circulated to anyone other than the members of the Appointing/interview Committee. <br><br>
                                Selection techniques not detailed in this policy should only be adopted with prior agreement and guidance from Recruiting Committee Convener. <br><br>
                                The questions posed at interview stage should be designed to gather evidence in relation to criteria being assessed at interview stage. <br><br>
                                All candidates short listed should be interviewed (written & Viva) on the same day. If this is not possible, the interviews should be held over as short a period of time as possible. All candidates should be seen and considered by the same Appointing Committee. <br><br>
                                HR Coordinator will contact all short-listed candidates to confirm interview details. <br>
                                HR Coordinator will write or explain over to all short-listed candidates giving interview details. <br>
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="pt30">9. Recommendation</h4>
                            <p>
                                Once a preferred candidate has been identified by the Committee, the Convener should complete the Interview Recommendation Form and all information, including one interview assessment form represent the collective view of the Appointing/interview Committee for each candidate, should be returned to the HR Coordinator.

                                On arrival, new staff members should be inducted by their line manager to introduce them to their department or School. The mentor will also work through a checklist with them to ensure they are familiar with arrangements for IT, health and safety and other important information.
                                <br><br>
                                Inductions will vary depending on whether the staff member is new or they are an existing staff member switching roles or returning from a long absence.
                                <br><br>
                                The first day for a new staff member in the office is particularly important. Faith in Action will want to make the new staff member feel welcome and enthusiastic about their new job.

                            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                            <p>In view of creating gender equality and gender friendly environment in the organization as well as in all its programs Faith in Action (FIA) has plan to operate integrated development programs in the community. These programs will enable to create a sustainable society and environment by personal and collective efforts of all level of stakeholders but initiative will be taken by FIA. FIA is committed to improve the economic, social and environmental situations of poor and powerless people in the community. The majority of the poor and powerless in the community is women. It is crucial to engage this section of population in the mainstream of development. Without their participation development is half done and would not sustain. Women are basic foundation of a family and they must be dignified and respected equally with the man. In the field of development there should be  no gender discrimination. In view of the development of women the organization will undertake few steps which will ensure the participation of women in organizational decision making process.</p>
                            <p>FIA believes that it is not possible solely by the organization itself to change the situation of women. FIA will initiate to aware and seeks direct and indirect participations of all related staffs of the organization as well as all other stakeholders like; non-government and government staff, local council members and civil societies.</p>
                            <p><strong>Initiatives of FIA in gender issues: </strong></p>
                            <p>FIA has been involved in promoting gender equality in the community through its programs since its beginning. The organization will undertake several activities to improve the situation of its staff and organized women group members as well as through its program interventions like; child education, training, income generating program (IGP), relief and rehabilitation, etc. The organization will continue different women and child development programs till women are being empowered in the community. Moreover the organization has recruited women and will be recruiting women in the mid-level positions to run its programs in view of facilitating more women. FIA encourages women to join its projects and programs. The organization feels that due to discriminating relationships between men and women in the society has become more complicated. FIA will create gender balance in the community taking different women development programs to reduce the vulnerability of women and children such as social exploitation, injustices, rights, child labor, dowry, divorce, wages, physical and mental abuse etc. </p>
                            <p>In view of this the organization will motivate women, provide skill training, provide self-help credit support and other opportunity to be aware and self-reliant which will eventually help them to be empowered. The empowerment of women will help to create gender balance in the community indeed. </p>
                            <p>Gender policy is a written document which will help to create a gender sensitive environment among all its staff, teachers, organized men and women, stakeholders, vendors and donors. And this policy will help to bring women in the main stream of development.</p>
                            <p>From the inauguration, FIA has been feeling the necessity of a gender policy for running its organizational programs and activities. The visit and discussion of Tear Australia also made it more clear the need of a gender policy. The main objective of this gender policy is to guide staffs for considering gender issues in all development programs and projects and its implementation, monitoring and evaluation process. This policy will help to take more tangible and dynamic participation of women in various development programs of FIA and simultaneously it will create impact in the family as well as in the society to accelerate gender equality. Gender policy will establish gender equality within FIA establishing gender friendly environment in all level of FIA programs. It would be gender friendly organization and there will be no discrimination of genders in recruitment, promotion, capacity building/training, leaves, salary and benefit etc. </p>

                            <p><strong>The steps for the participants in the program of FIA . </strong></p>
                            <p>FIA prioritizes on various gender issues, which is important for the success of its dev. programs. Because its programs are being designed and will design in order to develop women.

It was not easy for FIA to give importance to involve women in the mainstream development activities but we continued journey with strict management. FIA desires undertaking gender equity programs that will accelerate women development and these would include freedom of speak poverty alleviation, education, skill development, awareness, training, health education etc. All these programs will ensure woman participation in decision-making process. </p>
                            <p><strong>Women and poverty:</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>9. Faith in Action’s expectation from Partner Organization, consultants and contractors, </strong></p>
                            <p>Any agreement between the Faith in Action and partner organizations which need to work with children will require assurance that child protection policies and procedures are in place, acknowledging that lack of such policies can place children and the organization at risk and may become a factor for disqualification to enter into partnership. Faith in Action reserves the right to terminate contract negotiations with a partner organisation or individual, if any proposed personnel is believed to pose an unacceptable risk to children’s safety or wellbeing. </p>
                            <p><strong>10. Organizational mandates:</strong></p>

                                  <li>All staff and volunteers will have access to a copy of the child protection policy.</li>
                                <li>Induction will include briefing on child protection issues </li>

                            <p><strong>11. Confidentiality: </strong>An allegation of child abuse is a serious issue. In following this policy and local procedures, it is essential that all parties maintain confidentiality. Sharing of information, which could identify a child or an alleged perpetrator, should be purely on a ‘need to know’ basis. Unless abuse has actually been proved to have occurred, one must always refer to “alleged abuse”.</p>
                            <p><strong>12. Policy decision and Administration:</strong></p>

                                <li>Faith in Action personnel need to be aware that they may work with children who, because of the circumstances and abuses they have experienced, may use a relationship to obtain “special attention”.
