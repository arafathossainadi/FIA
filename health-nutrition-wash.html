                                <div class="text">
                                    I am Shilpi Biswas a 30 years old housewife.  I live in Ruizani, Mohammadpur, Magura. After the S.S.C exam, I got married to Tapon Biswas. He is a farmer and basically, we depend on agriculture for our living. Sometimes my husband had to work as a carpenter because we didn’t get enough crops in the past. Though we know that using chemical fertilizer is harmful to health but we used more and more chemical fertilizer to get enough crops for the whole year as we didn’t have any other choice. In 2.5.2013 I was admitted to Beli Sabolombi Mohila Somity run by FIA as a member. Then I got training on Vermin-compost. But that time vermin compost was not very familiar with farmers so my husband was not interested to invest in vermin compost. But I didn’t give up and started vermin compost on my own in a small pot and from that pot I gave some compost to my husband for use in his land. He used it and found that it was very useful. Then my husband helps me to manage two pots and corrugated Iron for making a vermin compost plot. Gradually my plot became bigger and vermin compost became famous among the villagers. One day Government agriculture officer paid a visit to my plot and gave me another two pots and corrugated iron to encourage my enthusiasm.
