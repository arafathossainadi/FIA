                                    <p>Shyamnagar Upazila is located in the south-west coastal area in the Satkhira district of Bangladesh. Faith in Action has been working in the area since December 2017 in 4 unions of this Upazila. The area is climate and disaster vulnerable.  Considering the Climate Change consequences situation Faith in Action is working there to build people’s adaptability so that they may survive in their community. The Field Organizer of SAT-ICDP of FIA is working in the Ishwaripur union. The Filed Organizer Ms. Kusum Sarkar was creating awareness on the consequences of Climate Change in their life and how they can build their resilience capacity. People were interested and they have united under the SHG. The field organizer went to Bongsipur Hotathpara village and talked about the vision and mission SAT-ICDP Project and she discussed the purpose of the formation of the self-help group (SHG). She went there several times and established a good relationship with the community. After few months few women become interested to form an SHG. Then the FO formed an SHG named Prottasha Sabolombi Mohila Somity with 25 members on 07/03/2018. </p>
                                    <p>Nazma Begum (37), President of Prottasha Sabolombi Mohila Somity is a housewife and her husband Emddadul Haque (50) is a Rikshaw puller in Dhaka. Their family consists of five members, of them three are their daughter. They are living below the poverty level.  Nazma was regular in the group and learned what was discussed in the weekly meetings and training sessions. She deposits 20/- weekly in her savings account. She was very keen to learn new things and practices in her family.</p>
                                    <p>Nazma is a challenge taker and she had a dream to do something by herself. She took initiative many times but failed, she always tried different and new things. She wanted to get a loan but the microcredit providers discouraged her as she was not in a position to payback.  She was struggling to fulfill her dream but after a few days, she applied to the SHG for a small loan and it was approved. She invested Tk. 2000/- in the clothes business. She moves house to house and village to village and sells different items of clothes i.e. Maxi, Lungi, Three Piece, Gamcha, Thankapor, and women’s undergarments.  She sells in less profit than the market and her sales were growing day by day and she invested her profit in business. Also refunded the loan in time and took 2nd loan of Tk. 4000/- and later on 3rd loan of Tk. 9000/- has invested in the same IGA.  She makes good profits and finds new hope for her family. Now, she is contributing to her family and meeting financial needs. She is also helping to meet the cost of children's education. She is encouraging other group members to start any IGA they like. Other members are encouraged to see her success. </p>
                                    <p>Being a mother and wife, business is extremely difficult to run but her husband and children helped and encouraged her a lot. They also appreciated her hard works. She already established a good linkage with different local markets for expanding her business. She is expecting to start a cloth shop in her community to create a job for others. Nazma is thankful to FIA. </p>

                            <h4>“NO” to child marriage - Hosneara an Example</h4>
                            <div class="text">Hosneara Parvin was born in an economically deprived coastal family from the Moukhali village under the Burigoalini Union which is known as one of the most vulnerable areas in Shyamnagar Upazila on the aspect of the disaster. She is 12 years old and a student of class VII at Nekjania High school. Hosneara became a member of the student club in February 2018 and like other girls, she is dreaming to be a doctor. Her father Khan Jahan is a fisherman and her mother Muktiara Begum is a housewife. Though Khanjahan’s income was not sufficient for the five-membered families but somehow, he could manage to provide support for his family. But COVID-19 and the cyclone, Amphan destroyed his livelihood completely. He became helpless and arranged a marriage for Hosneara to reduce the economic burden from his shoulder. Hosneara was shocked to hear the news and asked for help from the PB&J committee. She said, I don’t want to get married right now, I want to complete my studies, please help me. Mr. Shibashis Mondal, a school teacher of Nekjania High school and the President of the PB&J committee along with two other members from the committee and the respective FO, Joel Das went to her house to motivate her father not to arrange the marriage of her daughter. They tried to motivate him in every possible way but he said, “I understand everything but what should I do? I don’t have any option to support her studies”. Then PB&J President Mr. Shibasis Mondol assured him that he will manage her study support from the school. He requested Khanjahan, please don’t put her life in danger organized early marriage. She will die psychologically and you will put her life in threat. But if she could complete her study, she could contribute to your family and will have a better future with dignity and respect.  Realized his ignorance, Khan Jahan changed her decision and promised to not arrange her marriage before 18. Now Hosenara is very happy and said I will continue my studies and I will stand against child marriage in our community. </div>

                                    <p>Due to the geographical location, Manikkhali becomes one of the most vulnerable villages in the Ramjannagar Union of Shyamnagar Upazila. In this area, Salinity in the water, scarcity of drinking water, lack of sanitation, lack of nutrition, lack of livelihood are the most common problems like any other coastal area in Bangladesh. Four thousand people are living in this village and most of them are farmers and day labor. The project has started working in this area since March 2018. As there was no source of drinking water nearby people especially the women’s have to go far from their house to get water and most importantly they have to buy drinking water from the supplier which costs at least 600 takas per month for each of the family. Children are often suffering from water-borne diseases as some times they drink dirty water from pond or cannel when they don't have enough money to buy water. Under these circumstances, the project decided to install one Pond Sand Filter to reduce the drinking water crisis from the community.</p>
                                    <p>Rajani Kanta Barman, one of the SHG member’s father in law offered to use his land and pond to install PSF for the benefit of the community. After installation, a five-membered committee has been selected by the community to maintain the PSF. The committee members are responsible for cleaning the surroundings of the pond and PSF regularly. </p>
                                    <p>Now the villagers are very happy as the PSF makes their life easy and reduces their burden of buying drinking water for their family. Moyna Begum one of the SHG members said, “Now we don’t need to go far or wait for a long queue to buy drinking water, now we can get water whenever we want and it’s free”! Another group member Shoti Barman said, “Now we can save money from buying drinking water and from the doctors as well because now our children do not become sick often, PSF brings big changes in our life”.</p>

                                    <p>A 13 years old girl named Mosammat Muslimahasan was born with a hearing impairment. Her left ear was fully damaged and the right ear was 95% damaged. As she didn’t hear any sound she could not speak at all because her world was unspoken.</p>
                                    <p>Muslima’s parents separated when she was 7 years old. Muslima’s lives became uncertain from that day when her father refused to take any responsibility for her admeasured. Her mother was an uneducated housewife and had no working experience so they had to take shelter at her uncle’s house at Jangalia village under Mohammadpur Union. Her uncle Md. Kabul Miah offered a helping hand to Muslima and took initiative to admit her at school. But he was refused from the schools due to there was no specialized school in his area and the mainstream schools didn’t have the facility for the person with a disability. Her uncle suffered a lot but finally, he managed to admit Muslima a mainstream school named RSKH Institution at Mohammadpur. After getting admission Muslima started to face new challenges at the school. She lost her interest to go to school because everyone laughed at her and no one wants to become her friend.</p>
                                    <p>One day Muslima’s uncle contact Faith in Action’s staff because he heard that this organization is working for the person with a disability and provided assistive devices for them. FIA’s staff enlisted Muslima’s name and gave assurance to help her.</p>
                                    <p>On 11 & 12 August 2015 Faith in Action arranged a two-day long Bus Camp at Mohammadpur Upozila, Magura with the support of the SCANED project from the Centre for Disability in Development (CDD) were some specialized doctors (Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, An audiogram, and Visual) who came and provided medical assistance. From this bus camp, Muslima was examined and prescribed to get a hearing aid to solve her problem. But her problem was unsolved because the hearing aid was quite expensive for her uncle and he failed to manage the device. Then He requested a free Hearing Aid to the Executive Director of Faith in Action through the FIA’s staff. As FIA had no option to provide a Hearing Aid at that time, the Executive Director of FIA requested the SCANED project through CDD to consider a Hearing Aid for Muslima. As per the request, a specialized person from the SCANED project was sent with a Hearing Aid to fix the device. After fixing the device Muslima was flinched to hear the sound because that was the first time in her life that she heard something. She took the time to get used to it and after that, she was so happy and tried to express her happiness with her language (sign language). After a re-examined specialized person from CDD said that as Muslima can hear the sound now she will learn to speak very soon. By using her language, Muslima said I’ll continue my study and became a Government officer. We also hope that one day Muslima can speak and became a Government officer and serve the country.</p>

                                    <p>Aisha Akhter Sayma is the elder daughter of Mr. Abdul Ahad and Mrs. Rabeya Begum. They live in Dangapara village under Polash baria union, Mohammadpur, Magura. Aisha has a 6 years old brother who is attending Pre-primary school runes by Faith in Action. Her father is a farmer and her mother is a housewife. 10 years old Aisha was born with Cerebral Palsy. But her parents had no idea about cerebral palsy. They thought that it was the work of an evil spirit. So they took her to the shaman and other traditional healers. But when they didn’t saw any improvement of their daughter, they through all their hopes into the garbage and started to give more attention to their boy. One day Faith in Action’s staff was passing by their house and heard someone is screaming very loudly, he entered the house and found that Aisha was a tie-up with the rope-like an animal and bitten by her mother. FIA’s staff stops her mother and asked why you are doing this to your daughter? I’m fading up with this girl and I want her to die, she replied with tears. FIA’s staff realized the pain of a mother. He knows how difficult to manage a person living with cerebral palsy. He reassured that he will help her. He told Aisha’s parents that the injury and damage to the brain are permanent it does not “heal” but the impairment caused by Cerebral Palsy is manageable. Regular therapy and assistive technology will reduce her barriers and improving the quality of life. FIA’s staff started to give regular motivation to her parents in different issues like the rights and needs of a person with a disability and taught them how to give therapy. After getting regular therapy and proper care Aisha’s parents found a big difference in her life which was made them surprised. They found that before Aisha could not respond to anything at all but now she can respond. Her parents are very happy about these changes. They said that this change is possible with the help of FIA. Her father said now I spend more time with my daughter and every evening after my work I took her outside to visit our relatives or neighbors' residence for her entertainment. He said now we are more aware of our daughter and we will create awareness for those who have childlike my daughter.</p>

                                    <p>Latifa Begum is a housewife and a mother of two boys and one daughter. She lives with her family in Modinabad, Koyra. Her husband Khalilur Rahman is a rickshaw puller and lived in Khulna city for a better income. He was the only earning member of the family. Though the income was not sufficient for the family somehow they can manage their basic needs. Her elder son is dropped out of the school as they are not able to pay the school fees but the other children continuing their study. Latifa Begum became a member of Chander Alo SHG at Modinabad since it was formed on November 29,2019. Suddenly the source of income was stopped for her family and her husband has to return to Koyra with his Rikshaw as the Government declared a countrywide lockdown for the outbreak of Coronavirus. The whole family becomes helpless as they don’t have enough savings to start other businesses or find alternative work to live their life. Under these circumstances, one of our CF communicates with her over the phone as all the weekly meetings or social gathering is restricted by the government right at this moment. Latifa shared her situation with the CF and said with heavy-hearted that we have only four hundred takas left to live our lives and I don’t know what is going to happened with my family after finish this amount. After hearing her sad story our CF inspired her with logic to start making Iftar for selling in the village as it is the month of Ramadan and most of the villagers are Muslim. Most importantly all the Iftar shops in the markets are closed now. So it could be a profitable business for this time. She understands the logic and from that day she started making Iftar with her husband and invest all their savings on it. Surprisingly they made a profit of two hundred takas on the first day which was beyond their imagination. This profit made them confident and inspired them to continue the business. Nowadays they are making a profit three to four hundred takas every day by selling Iftar. Our CF regularly communicate with her and a few days back asked her what you are going to do after Ramadan? Do you have any plans? She answered with confidence, “first we give a new shape of our rikshaw and turned it to a van by changing its body, then we will start selling Chotpoti in our area so my husband doesn’t need to pull the rickshaw again. I will send my elder son to the school again and all are my children's become educated”.</p>
